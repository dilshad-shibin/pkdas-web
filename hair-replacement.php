<p>Patients use Botox to eliminate crow’s feet around the eyes, wrinkles on the forehead, and frown or laugh lines. Patients seek more and more of the nonsurgical options for anti-aging. Fillers have thus gained ground. Subtle enhancement in facial aesthetics with an emphasis on a more natural look constitutes the current trend and popularizes minimally invasive techniques in volumetric rejuvenation. It has become such a popular and ‘user friendly’ alternative to traditional cosmetic surgery.</p>
